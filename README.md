# Matrix Row Reduction to Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF)

This project implements matrix row reduction manually to transform a given matrix into its **Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF)**.  
The algorithm is coded step-by-step without using any built-in matrix decomposition libraries.

## Features
- Read or define matrices
- Apply elementary row operations
- Convert matrices to RREF form
- Display transformation steps

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy (optional if used)

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file: `RREF.ipynb`.
2. Follow the code cells in order.
3. Define your input matrix in the designated cell.
4. Run the provided functions to reduce the matrix to Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF).

## Project Structure

- `RREF.ipynb` â€” Main Jupyter Notebook containing all code, functions, and explanations for the matrix row reduction process.
