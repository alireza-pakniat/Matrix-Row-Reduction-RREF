# Matrix Row Reduction to Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF)

This project implements matrix row reduction manually to transform a given matrix into its **Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF)**.  
The algorithm is coded step-by-step without using any built-in matrix decomposition libraries.

## Features
- Read or define matrices
- Apply elementary row operations
- Convert matrices to RREF form
- Display transformation steps

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy (optional if used)

Install the required package using:

```bash
pip install numpy
